		[Unfinished mod,will restart the mod development after i'm back from modding]
we made our colony a Fortress, a tomb made of concrete
we put our cannons into, and we safely aim from inside.
we lure the enemy into, welcoming them with gunfire.
we live into,protect us from the threat outside.
Our funeral decorate are those mechanoids, Insectoid and of course those social parasite.
after we died, we will live in a tomb made of concrete.
